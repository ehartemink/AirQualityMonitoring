## What is this? 

I was curious about the air quality in and around my home. This repository implements data collection (and hopefully eventually visualization) for the concentration of various pollutants from a set of sensors I've connected to a raspberry pi.

## What's next? 

* Prototype the fetching and plotting of data on a web server
* Create a thread that periodically removes old data from the "database"
